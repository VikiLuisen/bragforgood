    "Brain scans show that giving lights up the same reward circuits as receiving. And compassion isn't just a personality trait. It's a skill you can train, like a muscle. Here's what the fMRI data actually shows.",

When participants chose to donate, their mesolimbic reward system lit up. That's the brain's pleasure center, the same region that fires when you eat good food, win a bet, or hear your favorite song. Giving triggered the same neural signature as receiving.",

Even the mandatory 'tax' transfers activated reward areas. Nobody chose to give, and their brains still registered it as pleasant. Voluntary giving added activation on top of that.",

Oxytocin doesn't make everyone generous all the time. Context matters, and individual differences play a role. But the overall direction is clear: prosocial behavior and oxytocin feed into each other in a positive loop. You help, your brain rewards you, which makes you more likely to help again.",
