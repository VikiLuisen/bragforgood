    "That warm feeling after helping someone? It's not in your head. Scientists have been studying it for decades, and the biology checks out. Helping others gets you high. Literally.",

Your body also pumps out oxytocin, which lowers blood pressure and calms inflammation. It's a cocktail your body mixes for free every time you're generous. No prescription needed.",

The catch? You can't be running yourself into the ground. The benefits disappear if you're overwhelmed by the helping itself.",

Your brain treats giving and receiving as the same category of good stuff.",
